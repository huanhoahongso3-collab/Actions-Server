#     name: "<new_command_name>"
#     enabled: true/false
#     aliases:
#       - "<new_command_aliases>"
#     permissions:
#       - "<new_command_permission>"
#     subCommands:
#       <default_sub_command_name>:
#         name: <new_sub_command_name>
#         enabled: true/false
#         aliases:
#           - "<new_sub_command_aliases>"
